                                                        Smart Contracts are programs (digital contracts) stored on a blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met. 
                                                        One of the interesting thing involved in executing a smart contract in Ethereum is the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/" target="_blank">Gas</a> usage, which is like the fee that one needs to pay to Ethereum for executing the smart contract. If one's smart contract needs more gas then they initially promised, then they lose their gas (read money) and the smart contract is terminated. Therefore, estimating the upper bound on gas usage for a given smart contract has been an active area of research.

                                                        Tensors are generalization of matrices to higher dimensions, and tensor network extends the matrix product. Multiplication of two tensors along a given axis is called as contraction. Given a set of tensors, a tensor network represents what tensors are to be contracted and along which axis/dimension.

                                                Like the product of multiple matrices, the time complexity of contracting a tensor network depends on the order in which the tensors are contracted. But unlike matrix product where the optimal sequence for the product can be found in polynomial time using dynamic programming, it is <b>NP</b>-Hard to find the optimal contraction sequence for a general tensor network. It is an area of active research to approximate the optimal contraction sequence.

                                                 Modern programmable blockchains have built-in support for smart contracts, i.e. programs that are stored
                                                on the blockchain and whose state is subject to consensus. After a smart contract is deployed on the
                                                blockchain, anyone on the network can interact with it and call its functions by creating transactions.
                                                The blockchain protocol is then used to reach a consensus about the order of the transactions and, as a
                                                direct corollary, the state of every smart contract. Reaching such consensus necessarily requires every node
                                                on the network to execute all function calls. Thus, an attacker can perform DoS by creating expensive
                                                transactions and function calls that use considerable or even possibly infinite time and space. To avoid
                                                this, following Ethereum, virtually all programmable blockchains have introduced the concept of “gas”. A
                                                fixed hard-coded gas cost is assigned to every atomic operation and the user who calls a function has to
                                                pay for its total gas usage. This technique ensures that the protocol is not vulnerable to DoS attacks, but
                                                it has also had significant unintended consequences. In Ethereum alone, out-of-gas errors, i.e. when a
                                                user misunderestimates the gas usage of their function call and does not allocate enough gas, are a major
                                                source of security vulnerabilities.
                                                We focus on the well-studied problem of automatically finding upper-bounds on the gas usage of a smart
                                                contract. This is a classical problem in the blockchain community and has also been extensively studied by
                                                researchers in programming languages and verification. In this work, we provide a novel approach using
                                                theorems from polyhedral geometry and real algebraic geometry, namely Farkas’ Lemma, Handelman’s
                                                Theorem, and Putinar’s Positivstellensatz, to automatically synthesize linear and polynomial parametric
                                                bounds for the gas usage of smart contracts. Our approach is the first to provide completeness guarantees
                                                for the synthesis of such parametric upper-bounds. Moreover, our theoretical results are independent of
                                                the underlying consensus protocol and can be applied to smart contracts written in any language and run
                                                on any blockchain. As a proof of concept, we also provide a tool, called “Asparagus” that implements our
                                                algorithms for Ethereum contracts written in Solidity. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results
                                                over 24,188 real-world smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We
                                                compare Asparagus against Gastap, which is the only previous tool that could provide parametric bounds,
                                                and show that our method significantly outperforms it, both in terms of applicability and the tightness of
                                                the resulting bounds. More specifically, our approach can handle 80.56% percent of the functions (126,269
                                                out of 156,735) in comparison with GASTAP’s 58.62%. Additionally, even on the benchmarks where both
                                                approaches successfully synthesize a bound, our bound is tighter in 97.85% of the cases.

                                                    Template-based synthesis, also known as sketching, is a localized approach to program synthesis in which the programmer provides not only a specification, but also a high-level ``sketch`` of the program. The sketch is basically a partial program that models the general intuition of the programmer, while leaving the low-level details as unimplemented ``holes``. The role of the synthesis engine is then to fill in these holes such that the completed program satisfies the desired specification. In this work, we focus on template-based synthesis of polynomial imperative programs with real variables, i.e.~imperative programs in which all expressions appearing in assignments, conditions and guards are polynomials over program variables. While this problem can be solved in a sound and complete manner by a reduction to the first-order theory of the reals, the resulting formulas will contain a quantifier alternation and are extremely hard for modern SMT solvers, even when considering toy programs with a handful of lines. Moreover, the classical algorithms for quantifier elimination are notoriously unscalable and not at all applicable to this use-case.

                                                    In contrast, our main contribution is an algorithm, based on several well-known theorems in polyhedral and real algebraic geometry, namely Putinar's Positivstellensatz, the Real Nullstellensatz, Handelman's Theorem and Farkas' Lemma, which sidesteps the quantifier elimination difficulty and reduces the problem directly to Quadratic Programming (QP). Alternatively, one can view our algorithm as an efficient way of eliminating quantifiers in the particular formulas that appear in the synthesis problem. The resulting QP instances can then be handled quite easily by SMT solvers. Notably, our reduction to QP is sound and semi-complete, i.e.~it is complete if polynomials of a sufficiently high degree are used in the templates. Thus, we provide the first method for sketching-based synthesis of polynomial programs that does not sacrifice completeness, while being scalable enough to handle meaningful programs. Finally, we provide experimental results over a variety of examples from the literature.

                                                    Membership inference (MI) attacks highlight a privacy weakness in present stochastic training methods for neural networks. It is not well understood, however, why they arise. Are they a natural consequence of imperfect generalization only? Which underlying causes should we address during training to mitigate these attacks? Towards answering such questions, we propose the first approach to explain MI attacks and their connection to generalization based on principled causal reasoning. We offer causal graphs that quanti- tatively explain the observed MI attack performance achieved for 6 attack variants. We refute several prior non-quantitative hypotheses that over-simplify or overestimate the influence of underlying causes, thereby failing to capture the complex interplay between several factors. Our causal models also show a new connection between generalization and MI attacks via their shared causal factors. Our causal models have high predictive power (0.90), i.e., their analytical predictions match with observations in unseen experiments often, which makes analysis via them a pragmatic alternative.

                                                    any anomaly should raise alarms immediately. A typical design would 
                                                    take the average from a window of say 10 seconds (time 
                                                    based) or 10 successive (count based) readings and look for sudden 
                                                    deviations. More sophisticated window definitions may be desired. E.g., 
                                                    we may want to select windows in which the maximum value of a field 
                                                    is greater than a fixed threshold. Existing stream processing systems 
                                                    either restrict to time or count based windows, or let users define 
                                                    customised
                                                    windows in imperative programming languages. These are subject to 
                                                    the implementers' interpretation of what is desired and hard to 
                                                    understand 
                                                    for others.

                                                    We introduce a formalism for specifying windows
                                                    based on Monadic Second Order logic. It offers several advantages over 
                                                    adhoc definitions written in 
                                                    imperative languages. We demonstrate four such advantages. First, we 
                                                    illustrate how practical streaming data queries can be easily written with 
                                                    precise semantics. 
                                                    Second, we 
                                                    get different formalisms (but that are expressively equivalent) for 
                                                    defining windows. We 
                                                    use one of them (regular expressions)
                                                    to design an end-user friendly language for defining windows. 
                                                    Third, we use another expressively equivalent formalism (automata) to 
                                                    design a processor that automatically generates windows according to 
                                                    specifications. The fourth advantage we demonstrate is more 
                                                    sophisticated. Some window 
                                                    definitions have the problem of too many windows overlapping with 
                                                    each other, overwhelming the processing engine. This is 
                                                    handled in different ways by different engines, but all the options are 
                                                    about what to do when this 
                                                    happens at runtime. We study this as a static analysis question and 
                                                    prove that it is undecidable to check whether such a scenario can ever 
                                                    arise for a given window definition. We identify a fragment for which the 
                                                    problem is decidable.

                                                    Weighted automata (WA) and linear cost register automata (LCRA) are two equivalent models of quantitative automata. LCRAs are deter- ministic finite-state automata with access to write-only registers that can be updated by combining other registers and constants using operations over a semiring. They give a different perspective for the class of functions computable by WA. For several natural classes of LCRA, we prove equiv- alence with well-known classes of WA, mostly by bounding the ambiguity of the latter.
